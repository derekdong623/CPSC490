    <h1>A Performant Game Engine and Monte-Carlo Tree Search Agent for Pokemon Battles</h1>
    <h3>Derek Dong</h3>
    <h3>Advised by James Glenn</h3>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p> With recent work developing superhuman competitors in games like Starcraft II and Quake III Capture the Flag (by
      DeepMind), and Dota 2 (by OpenAI), the development of agents to play video games is clearly an exciting frontier
      of machine learning research. Meanwhile, Pokemon is one of the most popular games that surprisingly has yet to
      truly be explored by the machine learning community. The many game mechanics like types, abilities, moves, and
      items interact in complex ways, but the overall strongly causal design of the game makes computational solutions
      especially appealing. So what would it take to develop an agent to win Pokemon battles? An important barrier is
      the limited quantity of game history data, linked to the relatively slow speed of game simulators. We build an
      engine using C++ that simulates Pokemon battles two to four orders of magnitude faster than Pokemon Showdown, the
      existing state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the engine’s performance by comparing the time it takes to run turn
      loops against the time that Showdown takes, and we provide an example of a Monte Carlo Tree Search agent that
      leverages the engine to quickly play through rollouts and search for the best move at a given state of battle. Our
      results are from standardized examples from Pokemon Run and Bun, chosen for its recent surge in popularity as well
      as its shockingly difficult battles. Our agent battles against teams handcrafted by competitive players and one of
      the smartest rule-based Pokemon opponents in Pokemon—and wins. Our engine is provided as a shared object file that
      can be imported into a Python environment, and our source code is available on GitHub.
